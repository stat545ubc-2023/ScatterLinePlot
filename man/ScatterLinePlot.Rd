\title{Create a Scatterplot with each points connected with grouping of a specific variable}
\usage{
ScatterLinePlot(data, group_var, x_var, y_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset to be plotted. Named "data" as it is the data frame that you are using to create the plot.}

\item{group_var}{A character variable used for grouping the data. Named "group_var" as it is the variable that you are grouping by.}

\item{x_var}{A numeric variable for the x-axis of the scatterplot. Named "x_var" as it is the variable that goes on the x-axis.}

\item{y_var}{A numeric variable for the y-axis of the scatterplot. Named "y_var" as it is the variable that goes on the y-axis.}
}
\value{
A scatterplot with each points connected by a line, grouped based on the specified variable.
}
\description{
This function creates a scatterplot with each of the points connected by a line, and is grouped based on a specified variable. It also filters out any NA values in the y variable.

# Load required packages (if not already loaded)

# Create a sample data frame

  X_var = rep(1:4, times = 3),
  Y_var = c(3, 5, 2, 6, 4, 7, NA, 8, 1, 3, 9, 4)
)

# Create a scatterplot with lines connecting points
